# swarmsible-hetzner

Companion repo to https://github.com/neuroforgede/swarmsible

# Why a separate repository?

Swarmsible is licensed under a MIT license. The hetzner integration for Ansible is licensed under GPL license.
To keep the separation between the codebases clear, all GPL logic for the hetzner part will be situated here.

Furthermore, this repository mostly concerns itself with spinning up the Cloud VMs while the swarmsible repository
is mostly cloud provider agnostic.
